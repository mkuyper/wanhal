# Missa in D

_Johann Baptist Wanhal (attribution dubious)_

[Nokki dubious 4](https://ilmondodellaluna.com/Wanhal/d4.html)  
Weinmann XIX:F5

Notes from _Catalogus novus Wanhali_:
> This work survives only in one peripheral source. Stylistically it is suspect
> on several grounds. Formally, the use of an instrumental introduction before a
> slow introduction in the Kyrie is unusual, and the setting of Qui sedes and
> Agnus Dei III as a separate movement is not observed elsewhere in Wanhal's
> works, nor is the reuse of movements (Et vitam for Benedictus II, Cum Sancto
> Spiritu for Agnus Dei III and In gloria Dei Patris for Dona Nobis). Even more
> confusing is the apparent chaos in the choice of keys and woodwind instruments:
> the wind players are expected to alternate between flutes, oboes and clarinets;
> the Kyrie is set in F, whereas D appears to be the main key of the rest of the
> work; the Credo begins in G but ends in D. If this is truly a work by Wanhal,
> it contains several experiments that he never returned to. It seems more likely
> that this is a potpurri of movements from different sources, some of which
> might have originated with Wanhal. In this case, the Cum Sancto Spiritu and In
> gloria Dei Patris fugue seem like the most likely candidates. It has, however,
> not been able to locate any movement in any of the other masses attributed to
> Wanhal.
