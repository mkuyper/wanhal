# J. B. Wanhal: Missae Dubiosae in D and in G

## What is this and why is it here?

It was perhaps in the early 2010s when I first stumbled upon Bohemian-born
composer [Johann Baptist
Wanhal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Baptist_Wanhal). His symphonies,
in particular the three from a
[recording](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lxydeGN8xvWPGYVItiTEYJ2HBl1Gm0UBA)
by Matthias Bamert and the London Mozart Players, were gaining in popularity
and receiving increasing play time on my local [classical music radio
station](https://www.radioswissclassic.ch/).

Intrigued by his style, not least by his use of minor-key
_Sturm-und-Drang_-like dramatism, I decided to have a look at what else he
might have composed. Thankfully, works attributed to Wanhal had been
[cataloged](https://cmc.wp.musiclibraryassoc.org/thematic-index/vanhal-johann-baptist-1739-1813/)
by scholars Paul Bryan (symphonies) and Alexander Weinmann (non-symphonic
works). These indices reveal an extraordinarily impressive corpus of works; his
output of over 1,300 compositions apparently included at least 100 quartets and
over 70 symphonies. Excitingly, the catalog also mentions over 100 sacred works
with at least 58 masses. As a life-long singer and avid (amateur) performer of
church music, to me this presented an interesting potential. Unfortunately,
only two of these masses appear to have been published, the rest survives only
in manuscripts and copies in a multitude of archives strewn all across Europe.

The [Répertoire International des Sources Musicales (RISM)](https://rism.info/)
proved an invaluable resource at revealing where these forgotten pieces may be
hiding. As luck would have it, copies of two masses listed in Weinmann's
catalog are being kept at the [music
library](https://www.kloster-einsiedeln.ch/agenda-kultur/kultur/musikbibliothek)
of [Einsiedeln Abbey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einsiedeln_Abbey) which was
but a stone's throw away from where I lived at the time. In 2015, I reached out
to archivist and librarian P. Lukas Helg who graciously invited me to view
those manuscripts at the abbey. This marked the beginning of this journey.

It was clear from the entries in RISM that these sources would be copies in
separate performance parts, and the scoring and movements were also listed.
However, other than single-voice incipits from the Kyries, no other information
was available. The actual nature of the works would thus only reveal itself
upon inspection.

On the afternoon of my scheduled appointment at the library I was warmly
greeted by the archivist who had already prepared the two manuscripts for
viewing. Unfortunately, P. Lukas was not able to shed any more light onto the
provenance of these sources. It is not known how or even when they came into
the possession of Einsiedeln Abbey. It seems that the documents alone must
speak for themselves. While he had other duties to attend, I was then left to
inspect and photograph the centuries-old pages. I couldn't help but wonder how
long it had been since someone read through them, much less when the music they
contained was last heard.

Since the works were in separate parts and thus without immediate context, it
was difficult — at least for an amateur like me — to get a clear picture of
what I had in front of me without reassembling it into a score first.
However, several peculiarities became apparent fairly quickly that started to
cast doubt on the authenticity of the attribution to Wanhal. Many of these have
since been pointed out in the respective entries of the [Catalogus novus
Wanhali](https://ilmondodellaluna.com/Wanhal/), a new catalog of Wanhal's work
that was not yet available then. At the time, I had also reached out a few
times to the [Johann Baptist Wanhal Association](https://wanhal.org/) to
inquire about the state of the musicological research into Wanhal's masses.
Unfortunately, that was not crowned with much success; perhaps because it was
non-existent or in its very early stages.

Nevertheless, I decided to proceed in my effort to transcribe the manuscript
parts so they can be assembled into scores. Even if it these masses were not
composed by Wanhal, and even if they are at times of at least questionable
musical quality, it seemed like these ancient parts deserved to be reassembled
into a single score after enduring in obscurity for so long.

And so, over the course of many years, I would return to these two masses every
once in a while and continue the transcription. I did this in no particular
order or fashion, just depending on how the mood hit me. I am not qualified by
any means of providing any musicological judgment, but every so often, a
freshly transcribed movement or passage will bring a smile to my face (and
ears). Surely, humanity has produced many works that are best confined to a
dusty shelf in a dark archive's basement, but I do not believe these two masses
should be among those.
