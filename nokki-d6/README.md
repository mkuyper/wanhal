Notes from _Catalogus novus Wanhali_:
> This work survives only in one peripheral source. It is stylistically
> plausible in, but employs tempo markings that either are not found in other
> masses (Andantino) or seem unusual for their context (Andante for the
> _Kyrie_), and no other work sets the _Crucifixus_ as a separate movement. The
> continuo section being tacet in the _Gratias_ and _Et incarnatus_ is also
> highly suspect.  Note that each section of the mass seems to be set in
> different tonalities, and that the Credo does not end with the same tonality
> as it began. As with Nokki dubious 4, this might be a mixing of music from
> different sources, where one or more movements are by Wanhal, but it has not
> been possible to provide any examples of borrowings from other works.
